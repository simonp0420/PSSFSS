`PSSFSS` is a Julia package for analyzing 
[polarization selective surfaces](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=polarization+selective+surface&btnG=) (PSSs), [frequency selective surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_selective_surface) (FSSs), 
[reflectarray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectarray_antennahttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectarray_antenna) elements, 
[radomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radome), and similar structures.  It is intended to be useful to antenna design engineers and others who work in applied electromagnetic engineering.

The user specifies the geometry to be analyzed as a `Vector` containing two or more dielectric [`Layer`](@ref)s 
and zero or more [`Sheet`](@ref) objects that define the PSS/FSS surfaces.  Due to the included plot recipes, the surfaces 
and their associated triangulations can be conveniently visualized using Julia's standard 
[`Plots`](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) package. After also specifying the scan angles or
unit cell incremental phasings, frequencies to be analyzed, and optionally selecting performance parameters to be written
to [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file(s), 
the user then invokes the [`analyze`](@refs) function to perform the analysis.  Post-processing and plotting of results can be
performed in the same analysis script using the immensely powerful Julia programming language.


## Features

* Designed to be useful and accessible to working engineers.
* Accommodates planar FSS/PSS surfaces with no limits to number of dielectric layers or FSS/PSS sheets.
* Automatically chooses number of modes needed for cascading multiple FSS/PSS sheets using
  generalized scattering matrices (GSMs).
* Supports (approximate) cascading multiple sheets of different periodicities, as in a multilayer
  meanderline polarizer.
* Simple specification of geometry to be analyzed.
* Solution of mixed-potential integral equation using Rao-Wilton-Glisson triangle subdomain basis functions 
  and multi-threaded method of moments.
* Fast analysis for frequency sweeps without approximations or interpolation using a wide-band expansion of the 
  potential Green's functions for a stratified medium with quasi-periodic excitation.
* Automatic triangulation of sheet geometries to user-specified number of triangles.
* Exploits redundancies inherent in structured meshes for greater numerical efficiency.
* Easy extraction of useful engineering performance parameters, including 
    * Reflection and transmission coefficient magnitudes and/or phases or complex coefficients for the field components of 
        * TE/TM 
        * Vertical/horizontal (Ludwig 3)
        * LHCP/RHCP (circular polarization)
    * Delta insertion phase delay (ΔIPD)
    * Delta insertion loss (ΔIL)
    * Axial ratio 

## Limitations

* Only zero-thickness FSS/PSS sheets are currently supported.
* Frequency sweeps are fast for normal incidence or for the case where unit cell incremental phase shifts ψ₁ and ψ₂ are constant
  with frequency (as in a waveguide).  Frequency sweeps where the angle of incidence is held constant are typically much slower (except for normal incidence).
